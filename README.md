# IoT-networks-over-RoF
IEEE 802.15.4 supports ZigBee for mesh networking but faces challenges in extending coverage to remote nodes. Radio over Fiber (RoF) improves network expansion with low latency, high capacity, and resistance to interference. This study evaluates RoFâ€™s impact on IEEE 802.15.4 and ZigBee networks through real-world testing.
